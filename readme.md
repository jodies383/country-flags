Country flag list
Given arrays of Country names and flags create a web page that show a list of countries with their flags.

const countries = ["Argentina", "Brazil", "Chile", "Zambia", "Uganda", "Malawi", "Rwanda", "Ireland", "Switzerland"];

const flags = ["ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·", "ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·", "ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡±", "ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡²", "ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¬", "ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¼", "ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¼", "ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª", "ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­"];
Possible approaches:

innerHTML with a Template String and the .map function.
createElement with appendChild.
